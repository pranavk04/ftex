!thm
We have that $V + E - F = 2$.

Let's look at an example. We know that there exists some sum that satisfies the solution.

There is some number $x \in \RR$ such that the following holds:

note that this exists
\[ \{ \sumkn f(k) = g(n) \}. \]

Here's another example:
fast tex
!ex
consider the function $f(x) = 2x$. This is linear because $\deg{f} = 2$.

Ok bye.
