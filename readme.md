# ftex
a **f**ast and simple way to use la**tex**!

## todo
1. custom starting file with templates
2. support more than just article class
3. extend default configuration options (math.conf) (command remaps, etc.)
4. custom environment bindings (envs.conf)
5. add continuous compilation support with a filewatcher (likely to pipe a python filewatcher output into the program stream, but this adds the additional dependency of python). 
6. document code properly
7. set up proper file structure (src, headers, etc.)
8. add support for including additional sty files
9. program the @literal wrapper to inject direct TeX code
10. create sensible default configurations for beginners
11. write documentation for the actual language (still don't know what to call it)
